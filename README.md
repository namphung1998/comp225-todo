This is a mobile to-do list application with a gamified aspect that makes it more rewarding for users to complete their tasks. 
The app is geared towards students and other people who desire a more enjoyable way to keep track of their tasks and celebrate their completion.

The project is bootstrapped using the [Expo](https://expo.io/) toolchain.
